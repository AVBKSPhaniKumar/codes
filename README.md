These are random  codes that i have written while studying books and papers. I want to organize them at one particular place 
get_binary.py --> contains codes that are can be used to convert a decimal number to binary and viceversa
powerset.py --> contains a code which is used to find the set of subsets of a particular set. This is written in O(n^3) which i think can be optimized further
